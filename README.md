# Task Board Starter Code

## description

This project is a basic kanban (a visual work management task board developed by Toyota's legendary lean process improvement team). The user can enter tasks with due dates and descriptions. These tasks are transformed into draggable objects that are then moved between the "to-do" list, the "in-process" list, and the "completed" list. The draggability gives a real-world feel to this online task board.

As a new developer, I learned how modals work and how to use JS to create HMTL elements and CSS styles and how to manipulate the DOM to make a fun, interactive and user-friendly web app.

Thanks to John Young, Zac Warner, Alistair Rowden, Ntombifuthi Motaung: Educational team at edX/UCB FS Bootcamp, for instruction and help. Specific credits to follow.

Starter code from edX class repository, FS Web Dev Week 5 Project, specifically:
CSS lines 1-16 (I added the rest) and the first line of all JS functions (which I fleshed out with help from TA Zac and tutors Ntombifuthi and Alastair).

Tala Awwad, An Sung-Min: classmates from UCB FS Bootcamp with whom I discussed the project; Tala shared her bootstrap modal which became my modal in the HTML and gave me some advice on the JS functions in addition to the TA/tutors.

Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/.

draggable ui: (CSS): I learned this trick from a post on Stackoverflow.com to bring the draggable tasks 5000 layers to the front of the display.
